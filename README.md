aiomotorengine
==============

aiomotorengine is a port of the [motorengine](http://motorengine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) which uses Motor for asynchronous access to MongoDB and Asyncio's event loop instead Tornado's one. It also uses new syntax `async def` and `await` for asynchronous code introduced in python 3.5
