AIOMotorEngine
==============

Warning
-------

Instead of this repository it is prefered to use `asyncio` branch (https://github.com/ilex/motorengine/tree/asyncio) of `motorengine` as it much more compatible with `motorengine`. Instead of ``aiomotorengine`` use ``motorengine.aiomotorengine``.

About
-----

`aiomotorengine` is a port of the [motorengine](http://motorengine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) which uses Motor for asynchronous access to MongoDB and Asyncio's event loop instead of Tornado's one. It also uses new syntax `async def` and `await` for asynchronous code introduced in python 3.5

Install
-------

To install `AIOMotorEngine` use `pip`:

    $ pip install https://github.com/ilex/aiomotorengine/archive/master.zip
